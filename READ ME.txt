This project aims to develop an automated attendance system that utilizes facial recognition technology to enhance efficiency and accuracy in tracking attendance in educational institutions and workplaces.
The system employs machine learning algorithms, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, to identify and verify individuals based on their facial features captured through a camera, reducing manual effort and potential errors associated with traditional attendance methods.
A robust database of facial images is created, and real-time processing is implemented to match live captured images against stored data using distance-based comparisons by KNN. The system is designed to handle variations in lighting, angles, and facial expressions to improve recognition accuracy.
Initial tests demonstrate a high accuracy rate in face recognition using KNN, significantly minimizing time spent on roll calls and enabling instant attendance logging, thus providing a scalable solution for larger groups.
