In the near future, face recognition-based attendance systems will be utilized in all places instead of the traditional approach; it may even replace biometric attendance systems. The goal of this project is to create a new attendance system based on real-time facial recognition. This project aims to develop a face recognition-based attendance system using machine learning techniques. The proposed system utilizes Python programming language and K-Neighbors Classifier algorithm for face recognition. The proposed system recognizes and encodes the unique traits of the faces in the database into a pattern image. Python modules are employed in our suggested system, and a machine learning approach called K-Neighbors Classifier is used to discover the person's name. The steps of the operation are image capture, facial features, face recognition, and an attendance system. This model combines a camera that records an input image, an algorithm for detecting faces in input images, encoding and identifying the faces, and recording attendance in a spreadsheet. The training database is built by inputting the faces of permitted pupils into the system. After that, the cropped photographs are saved in a database with their associated labels. The attendance is recorded using the matching face. The system will be capable of automatically capturing the image of individuals and verifying their identity based on their facial features. The system will then mark their attendance accordingly, providing a convenient and accurate way of tracking attendance. The system will be implemented in real-time and will be able to handle multiple users simultaneously. This project provides an efficient solution for attendance management in various industries such as schools, colleges, and offices, reducing the manual effort and errors associated with traditional attendance systems.
